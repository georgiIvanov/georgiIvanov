<h3>Hey, I'm Georgi 👋 🧑🏼‍💻</h3>
<p>
  I'm a software engineer with a knack for simplifying things and writing clean code. ✨
</p>

<p>
  I live and breathe <b>iOS</b>, but in my day-to-day work I also write <b>Flutter</b>. I'm no stranger to backend technologies like <b>NestJS</b> and <b>ASP.NET</b>. And when things really get down to business I know my way around automating work with <b>Python</b> or <b>Ruby</b>. I firmly believe Mobile DevOps is a thing.
